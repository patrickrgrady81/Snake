# PaddySnake (front end)
This is a snake game based on the old nokia snake I used to play on my flip phone. I made slight changes to the ideas in that game. I like the fact that I can go through walls Pacman style. Also, with the backend players can register and login to get their scores saved in the top 10 if they are good enough.

## Usage
Run on LiveServer or any other front end server you wish then run the backend.
